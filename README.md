# Soil Fertility Prediction and Crop Recommendation 

Project uses machine learning to analyze soil parameters and determine whether the soil is fertile. If the soil is fertile, the system recommends suitable crops to help farmers improve agricultural productivity and decision-making.

---

## Project Workflow
1. Analyze soil parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
2. Check whether the soil is fertile based on nutrient levels and pH range.
3. If the soil is fertile, recommend suitable crops using a trained machine learning model.
